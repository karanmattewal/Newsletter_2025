Technical education blended with ethics and quality comprises of one of the most powerful tools, which gives shape to the coming generations. We at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana are trying our level best to make optimized utilization of modern tools and techniques, so that quality technical education can come within the reach of the large masses of India with convenience and affordability.
I am very hopeful that the publishing of the present College Newsletter will showcase our valuable achievements to the world, which the students and staff have made in spite of all the past and ongoing natural and man-made hurdles.
I am thankful to God almighty for making us capable to perform these tiny but effective efforts. Last but not the least, I congratulate the whole Editorial Board and all involved for their fine individual and team work.

Dr. Kanwardeep Singh    
Associate Professor and H.O.D.

### Student's Achievements

Project filed for Patent.

- **Abhishek Goyal, Gurpartap Singh, Kunal Singla and Mainik Walia**
 made the project "Sky Robot" under the guidance of **Dr. Arvind Dhingra** .This robot is to help maintain a vigil against unwanted intruders. The robot is so designed so as to work effectively during day and night with same efficiency. The robot is capable of sending an alarm in case of any unwanted activity. This will help our soldiers guarding our borders to maintain effective vigil.

- **Santokh Singh, Sapandeep Singh,Simranjeet Singh and Harpreet Singh** made the project "Palace Power Saver" under the guidance of **Pf. Arshdeep Kaur**. One of the major reason for designing this project, is the wastage of electricity especially at palaces, libraries, hostels, hotels, cinemas, parking and offices, where no one take responsibility to switch off the electrical equipment. This project is based on an intelligent electricity system which  automatically switched off the light/equipment when the room will empty.
