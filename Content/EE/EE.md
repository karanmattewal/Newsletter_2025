## Student's Corner  

![project](Images/PRJ.jpeg)
An industrial visit to Sunhome Cable Industries Private Limited, Chandigarh was organized under the guidance of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) for the students of Electrical Engineering from Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College. The visit was conducted with the participation of two faculty members and twenty-nine students, with the objective of providing practical exposure to industrial manufacturing practices and quality standards related to electrical cables.

### Student's Achievements

Project filed for Patent.

- **Abhishek Goyal, Gurpartap Singh, Kunal Singla and Mainik Walia**
 made the project "Sky Robot" under the guidance of **Dr. Arvind Dhingra** .This robot is to help maintain a vigil against unwanted intruders. The robot is so designed so as to work effectively during day and night with same efficiency. The robot is capable of sending an alarm in case of any unwanted activity. This will help our soldiers guarding our borders to maintain effective vigil.

- **Santokh Singh, Sapandeep Singh,Simranjeet Singh and Harpreet Singh** made the project "Palace Power Saver" under the guidance of **Pf. Arshdeep Kaur**. One of the major reason for designing this project, is the wastage of electricity especially at palaces, libraries, hostels, hotels, cinemas, parking and offices, where no one take responsibility to switch off the electrical equipment. This project is based on an intelligent electricity system which  automatically switched off the light/equipment when the room will empty.
